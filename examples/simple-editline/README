This is the most simple example that demonstrates a common use-case for
libecoli. It shows how to build a custom cli based on libedit, with completion
and contextual help.

The top-level helpers of ec_editline API are used (ec_interact()), making the
code as compact as possible.

The grammar is defined in one function create_commands(). The callbacks are
registered using ec_editline_set_callback(), and the contextual helps using
ec_editline_set_help().
